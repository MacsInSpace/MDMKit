# MDMKit

Modern, cross-platform PowerShell 7 modules for Apple MDM platforms — built for 2026, not ported from 2019.

| Module | Status | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **[JamfProKit](JamfProKit/)** | v0.5.0-alpha | [Jamf Pro](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-pro/) — Jamf Pro API (JSON) + Classic API (XML) |
| **[JamfSchoolKit](JamfSchoolKit/)** | v0.1.0-alpha | [Jamf School](https://www.jamf.com/products/jamf-school/) — Jamf School API (first PowerShell module for it) |
| **[MosyleKit](MosyleKit/)** | v0.3.0-alpha | [Mosyle Manager](https://mosyle.com/) — Mosyle Manager API (JWT) |
| **[MosyleFreeKit](MosyleFreeKit/)** | v0.5.1-alpha | [Mosyle Manager **Free**](https://mosyle.com/) — browser session, no paid API token |

One repo, one module per platform. Each MDM has its own API — different auth, versioning and
conventions — so each gets a module that fits it properly rather than a lowest-common-denominator
wrapper. They live together because they share a design (hardened request engine, session model,
strict-mode-clean cross-platform PowerShell), one issue tracker, and one release pipeline. Each
module installs independently from the PowerShell Gallery.

## Highlights (JamfProKit)

- **OAuth client credentials first** (API Roles and Clients), user bearer tokens too — automatic renewal either way
- **One hardened request engine**: retry with backoff honoring `Retry-After`, 401 token refresh, pagination, Jamf Cloud sticky sessions
- **MUT-style bulk operations**: [The MUT](https://github.com/jamf/mut)'s CSV templates pipe *directly* into `Update-JamfComputer`, with `-WhatIf` previews and per-row result objects the GUI never had
- **Live-spec generic layer**: reads your instance's own OpenAPI schema (`/api/schema`) so coverage tracks whatever your server runs
- **Strict-mode clean, macOS-native**, PowerShell 7.4+, CI on macOS/Linux/Windows

See each module's README for its full tour, cmdlet list and roadmap, and the acknowledgements to
the community projects that mapped this territory first.

## A note on MosyleFreeKit

The other three modules target documented, vendor-supported APIs. **MosyleFreeKit does not** —
Mosyle Manager Free has no API token, so that module drives the web UI's own private endpoints
with your browser session. It is useful, and it is not the same kind of thing: the endpoints are
unversioned and can change without notice, some operations the UI badges "Premium" are
nonetheless accepted by the server, and its command bus returns a soft `OK` that is not proof a
command queued. If the paid API add-on is an option for your school, **[MosyleKit](MosyleKit/)**
is the supported path. Read [MosyleFreeKit's scope note](MosyleFreeKit/#scope-and-caution) before
using it.
